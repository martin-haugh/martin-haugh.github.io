At Imperial I've been teaching Decision Analytics for the full-time and part-time MBA programs and several courses (Foundations of Maths & Statistics, Advanced Machine Learning, Financial Analytics) for the MSc in Business Analytics. In spring 2023 and 2024 I co-taught an MRes / PhD course on Machine Learning for Analytics, Marketing and Operations.
