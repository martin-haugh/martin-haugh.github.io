At Imperial I've taught Decision Analytics for the full-time and part-time MBA programs and several courses (Foundations of Maths & Statistics, Advanced Machine Learning, Financial Analytics) for the MSc in Business Analytics. In spring 2023 and 2024 I co-taught an PhD course on Machine Learning for Analytics, Marketing and Operations and since spring 2024 I've been teaching a PhD course on Stochastic Processes.

I have taught the following courses for the MSFE and MSOR programs in the IE & OR Department at Columbia University. Course material in some instances can be found by following the corresponding link.
