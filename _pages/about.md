I am an Associate Professor of Analytics and Operations Research at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/) where I have been since September 2017. Prior to that I spent more than 10 years in the Department of IE & OR at Columbia University as well as 4 years working as a quant  in the hedge fund industry in New York and London. I have a Ph.D. in [Operations Research](http://orc.mit.edu/) from MIT and MSc degrees in [Applied Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/) from the University of Oxford and University College Cork, respectively.

## Research
My main research interests are in the areas of:
1. **Quantitative finance and risk management**  <br/>     
    Recently I've been working on problems related to portfolio optimization with taxes as well as scenario analysis in risk managment. I've also done some work on derivatives pricing (American, swing and leveraged ETF options) and dynamic portfolio optimization. 
2. **Dynamic programing and stochastic control**  <br/>    
    <font size = "-1"> I've mainly been working on the problems related to information relaxations. These ideas allow for the construction of tight lower and upper bounds on the optimal value functions of problems where it is too difficult to compute the optimal value function and policy exactly. </font>
3. **Data analytics** <br/>   
   <font size = "-1"> I've been working in the area of sports analytics recently and have also begun working on some problems related to politics and elections. </font>

My research papers can be found [here](/publications).
## Teaching
All of my teaching at Columbia was at the graduate level and mainly focussed on various courses for the MSc degrees in Financial Engineering and Operations Research. Lecture notes and slides for these courses are available [here](/teaching). Since moving to Imperial, my teaching has been for the full-time and part-time MBA programs and the MSc in Business Analytics.

In spring 2013 I co-taught with Garud Iyengar one of the first three MOOCs, i.e. massive open online courses, to be offered by Columbia University. The course was called Financial Engineering and Risk Management and it also featured an interview with Emanuel Derman. This course has now been split into two separate 6-week courses, [FE & RM Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe1) and [FE & RM Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe2). Business Insider listed FE & RM Part I as one of the [best free online business courses](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-free-online-business-courses-2013-10?op=1).

In 2013 I was also awarded the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association’s Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award for excellence in teaching. In 2019 I received the TEaching Excellence Award for Core Module MBA teaching.
